## üìã WORKFLOW: HOW WE WORK TOGETHER

### **Scenario 1: Starting New Issue**

**Step 1: I Analyze**
```markdown
Issue #3: Database Schema

Analysis:
- Need 5 tables (tenders, details, documents, fields, logs)
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM
- Estimated time: 2 days

Questions for You:
1. SQLite or PostgreSQL?
2. Store dates as TEXT or DATETIME?
```

**Step 2: You Decide**
```markdown
Decisions:
1. ‚úÖ SQLite for now (can migrate later)
2. ‚úÖ Store dates as TEXT (ISO format)

Approved to proceed ‚úÖ
```

**Step 3: I Execute**
```markdown
Status: IN PROGRESS
- Created models.py
- Added relationships
- Writing tests
- ETA: Tomorrow 5 PM
```

**Step 4: You Review & Approve**
```markdown
PR Review: ‚úÖ APPROVED
- Code looks good
- Tests passing
- Documentation complete

Merged to main
```

### **Scenario 2: Blocker Encountered**

**I Report:**
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKER - Issue #1

Problem: API returns 403 on AWS

Attempted:
1. ‚úÖ Verified headers
2. ‚úÖ Checked session
3. ‚úÖ Tested locally (works)
4. ‚ùå Still fails on AWS

Hypothesis: AWS IP blocked by site

Options:
A) Setup VPN on AWS
B) Use Selenium instead
C) Contact site admin

Recommendation: Option B (Selenium)

YOUR DECISION NEEDED
```

**You Respond:**
```markdown
Decision: Try Option A first (VPN)

Reasoning: Selenium is slower
Budget: Approve $10/month for VPN

If VPN fails in 2 days ‚Üí switch to Option B

APPROVED ‚úÖ
```
