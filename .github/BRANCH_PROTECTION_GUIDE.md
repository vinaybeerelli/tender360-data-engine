# Branch Protection Rules Configuration Guide

## üéØ Goal
Set up branch protection that provides security WITHOUT blocking your workflow, especially for Copilot agent development.

---

## üìã Recommended Settings for `main` Branch

### ‚úÖ What to Enable

#### 1. **Require Pull Request Reviews** (Optional - Use with care)
```
Setting: DISABLED for solo developer
Reason: You don't want to block yourself
Alternative: Enable only if working with a team
```

#### 2. **Require Status Checks to Pass**
```
Setting: ENABLED (but not required for pushing)
‚òëÔ∏è Require branches to be up to date before merging
‚òëÔ∏è Status checks that are required:
   - CI Pipeline (Test & Lint) - OPTIONAL
   - CodeQL Security Analysis - OPTIONAL
```

**Configuration:**
- Go to: `Settings` ‚Üí `Branches` ‚Üí `Branch protection rules` ‚Üí `Add rule`
- Branch name pattern: `main`
- Check: "Require status checks to pass before merging"
- **IMPORTANT:** Do NOT check "Require branches to be up to date" if you want to push directly

#### 3. **Require Conversation Resolution**
```
Setting: DISABLED
Reason: Blocks merging if there are unresolved comments
Use only if: Working with a team
```

#### 4. **Require Signed Commits**
```
Setting: OPTIONAL
Reason: Good security practice but requires GPG setup
```

#### 5. **Require Linear History**
```
Setting: DISABLED
Reason: Prevents merge commits, requires rebase
Use only if: You want clean history and understand rebasing
```

#### 6. **Include Administrators**
```
Setting: DISABLED
Reason: Allows you (as admin) to bypass rules when needed
```

#### 7. **Restrict Who Can Push**
```
Setting: DISABLED
Reason: You want to push directly
Use only if: Multi-user repo
```

#### 8. **Allow Force Pushes**
```
Setting: ENABLED (with restrictions)
Options:
  - Everyone: DISABLED
  - Specify who can force push: ENABLED (Add yourself)
Reason: Lets you fix mistakes but prevents accidents
```

#### 9. **Allow Deletions**
```
Setting: DISABLED
Reason: Prevents accidental branch deletion
```

## üöÄ Workflow-Friendly Configuration

### **Option A: Minimal Protection (Recommended for Solo Dev)**

```yaml
Branch: main

‚úÖ Require status checks (optional, not blocking)
‚úÖ Allow force pushes (for admins only)
‚ùå Require pull request reviews
‚ùå Require conversation resolution
‚ùå Include administrators (so you can bypass)
‚ùå Restrict pushes
‚úÖ Prevent deletions
```

**Result:** You can push directly to main, but CI runs to check code quality.

---

### **Option B: Moderate Protection (Team Development)**

```yaml
Branch: main

‚úÖ Require status checks (CI must pass)
‚úÖ Require 1 pull request review (can be waived for admins)
‚úÖ Require conversation resolution
‚ùå Include administrators (so you can bypass when needed)
‚úÖ Restrict pushes (specify allowed users/teams)
‚úÖ Prevent deletions
‚úÖ Allow force pushes (admins only)
```

**Result:** Normal workflow uses PRs, but admins can bypass for urgent fixes.

---

### **Option C: No Protection (Maximum Flexibility)**

```yaml
Branch: main

‚ùå All rules disabled
```

**Result:** Complete freedom, rely on CI workflows and code review discipline.

---

## üîß Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Navigate to Repository Settings
```
GitHub ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Branches
```

### 2. Add Branch Protection Rule
```
Click: "Add rule" or "Add branch protection rule"
Branch name pattern: main
```

### 3. Configure Rules (Recommended for Solo Dev)
```
‚òê Require a pull request before merging
   ‚òê Require approvals: 0
   
‚òë Require status checks to pass before merging
   ‚òê Require branches to be up to date before merging
   Status checks found in the last week:
      ‚òê CI Pipeline (optional)
      ‚òê CodeQL (optional)
   
‚òê Require conversation resolution before merging

‚òê Require signed commits

‚òê Require linear history

‚òê Include administrators
   (Leave UNCHECKED so you can bypass rules)
   
‚òê Restrict who can push to matching branches

‚òë Allow force pushes
   ‚òë Specify who can force push
      Add: your-username
   
‚òê Allow deletions
```

### 4. Save Changes
```
Click: "Create" or "Save changes"
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è `develop` Branch Settings

For a development branch that feeds into main:

```yaml
Branch: develop

‚úÖ Require status checks (CI must pass)
‚ùå Require pull request reviews (optional)
‚ùå Include administrators (you can bypass)
‚úÖ Allow force pushes (admins only)
‚úÖ Prevent deletions
```

**Workflow:**
```
feature-branch ‚Üí develop ‚Üí main
                   ‚Üì         ‚Üì
               (CI checks) (Protected)
```

---

## ü§ñ Agent-Friendly Workflow

### Recommended Git Workflow for Copilot Agents

```bash
# Agent creates a feature branch
git checkout -b copilot/agent-alpha-issue-1

# Agent makes changes
# ... coding ...

# Agent commits
git add .
git commit -m "[ALPHA] Issue #1: Fix API scraper"

# Agent pushes to feature branch
git push origin copilot/agent-alpha-issue-1

# Create PR from GitHub UI or CLI
gh pr create --title "[ALPHA] Issue #1: Fix API scraper" \
             --body "..." \
             --base main

# After CI passes and review (if required), merge
gh pr merge --squash
```

### Direct Push Workflow (No Protection)

```bash
# Work directly on main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Make changes
# ... coding ...

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "[ALPHA] Issue #1: Fix API scraper"
git push origin main
```

---

## üîç Testing Your Configuration

### Test 1: Can You Push Directly?
```bash
echo "test" > test.txt
git add test.txt
git commit -m "test: check branch protection"
git push origin main
```

**Expected:**
- If protected: Error message or requires PR
- If not protected: Push succeeds

### Test 2: Can You Force Push? (Be Careful!)
```bash
git push --force origin main
```

**Expected:**
- Should fail unless you're in the allowed list
- Good security practice

### Test 3: Do CI Checks Run?
```bash
git push origin main
# Check GitHub Actions tab
```

**Expected:**
- Workflows run automatically
- You can see results in the "Actions" tab

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "You're not authorized to push to main"
**Solution:**
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Edit rule
- Uncheck "Include administrators"
- Or add yourself to "Allow specific actors to bypass"

### Issue 2: "Required status check has not run"
**Solution:**
- Push a commit to trigger the workflow
- Or in Settings ‚Üí Branches, uncheck the specific required check
- Or uncheck "Require status checks to pass"

### Issue 3: "Pull request required"
**Solution:**
- Either create a PR
- Or go to Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Edit rule
- Uncheck "Require a pull request before merging"

### Issue 4: CI Blocks Merging
**Solution:**
- Fix the failing tests
- Or go to Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Edit rule
- Change required checks from "Required" to "Optional"
- Or use "Merge without waiting for requirements to pass" (admin override)

## üìä Rule Sets (GitHub's New Feature)

As of 2024, GitHub introduced "Rulesets" as a more flexible alternative to branch protection rules.

### Benefits of Rulesets
- More granular control
- Can target multiple branches with patterns
- Better bypass controls
- More comprehensive rules

### How to Access
```
Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Rules ‚Üí Rulesets
```

### Recommended Ruleset for Your Project

```yaml
Ruleset Name: "Main Branch Protection"
Enforcement: Active
Bypass: Allow administrators to bypass

Target:
  - Branch: main
  - Branch: develop

Rules:
  ‚òë Require a pull request before merging (Disabled)
  ‚òë Require status checks
     Status checks: CI Pipeline (optional)
  ‚òë Block force pushes (with exceptions)
     Exceptions: Repository administrators
  ‚òë Require signed commits (optional)
  ‚òê Require deployments to succeed
```

## üéØ Best Practices for Your Use Case

### For Solo Development with Copilot Agents

1. **Don't block yourself** - Keep branch protection minimal
2. **Use CI for quality** - Let workflows run but don't require them to pass
3. **Create PRs for visibility** - Good for tracking, not enforcement
4. **Enable security scanning** - CodeQL, Dependabot (non-blocking)
5. **Use feature branches** - Good practice even if not required

### For Team Development

1. **Require PRs** - At least 1 reviewer
2. **Require CI to pass** - Quality gate
3. **Use CODEOWNERS** - Auto-assign reviewers
4. **Protect main and develop** - Different rules for each
5. **Document exceptions** - When/why to bypass rules
